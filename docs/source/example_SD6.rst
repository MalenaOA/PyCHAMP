Sheriden 6 Local Enhanced Management Area (SD-6 LEMA) Model
===========================================================

Background of the SD-6 LEMA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SD-6 LEMA represents a grassroots initiative for groundwater management that commenced in 2012, part of the LEMA program within the High Plains Aquifer region of western Kansas. With the objective of curtailing groundwater consumption by capping the water rights at 55 inches per unit area over a five-year period, SD-6 LEMA has completed two full cylces, first from 2013 to 2017 and subsequently from 2018 to 2022. Water use diminished by 33.6% in the first period and by 36.8% in the second. The upcoming section provides an overview of how PyCHAMP can model the complex interactions between human activities and water systems, employing SD-6 LEMA as an illustrative example, as detailed in the referenced article.

Setting up a complete simulation of the SD-6 LEMA model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Input Data and Model Structure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

SD-6 LEMA model, which is based on MESA 2.1.1 framework, is set up utilizing aquifer, field, well, finance, and behavior classes described within this documentation. To initiate and run an SD-6 LEMA simulation with each farmer managing a single well and field, the required input data are given in the table below.

.. csv-table:: Required inputs to run an SD-6 LEMA simulation
   :file: dataForSimulation.csv
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

In this example, we validate the model's ability to capture agro-hydrological dynamics in a stakeholder-driver groundwater scheme by using observed data, which includes groundwater withdrawal, saturated thickness, and the types or proportions of crops grown in the fields.

Execution Steps
"""""""""""""""

1. Import the SD-6 LEMA model from PyCHAMP.

.. code-block:: python

	from py_champ.models.sd6_model import SD6Model

2. Import necessary library and load a pickle file containing all the input dictionaries for different classes, along with pre-calculated available precipitation for each crop, based on its growing season. The pickle file can be downloaded from *https:where??s*. For a detailed understanding of creating your own input file, refer to :ref:example_l and :ref:example_2.

.. code-block:: python

	import dill

	# set up a working directory (wd) and load the inputs
	file_path =  wd + "/Inputs_SD6.pkl"

	with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
	    (aquifers_dict, fields_dict, wells_dict, finances_dict, behaviors_dict,
	     prec_aw_step, crop_price_step, shared_config) = dill.load(f)

3. Load the required observed data to validate model's ability to simulate real world human water interaction. The csv file can be accessed at **give link??**

.. code-block:: python
	
	data = pd.read_csv(join(wd, "Data_SD6.csv"), index_col=["year"])

4. Load other necessary inputs.

.. code-block:: python

	# crop type for the simulation
	crop_options = ["corn", "sorghum", "soybeans", "wheat", "fallow"]
	
	# type of irrigation technology available
	tech_options = ["center pivot LEPA"]

	# number of splits for each field 
	area_split = 1

	# seed for model replicability and comparison
	seed = 12345

	# calibrated parameters for simulation 
	pars = {'perceived_risk': 0.7539,
	 'forecast_trust': 0.8032,
	 'sa_thre': 0.1421,
	 'un_thre': 0.0773}

5. Initialize a new instance of the model and run the simulation for the required number of steps, which is from 2008 to 2022 in this case.

*Note that the dicitonaries for each of the classes are loaded into the pickle file*.

.. code-block:: python
	
	m = SD6Model(
	    pars=pars, 
	    crop_options=crop_options, 
	    tech_options=tech_options, 
	    area_split=area_split, 
	    aquifers_dict=aquifers_dict,

	    # kwargs
	    crop_price_step=crop_price_step
	    )

	for i in range(15):
	m.step()

6. Load the model-level and agent-level data after the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

	# read outputs for attributes related to different agent types
	df_farmers, df_fields, df_wells, df_aquifers = SD6Model.get_dfs(m)

	# read system level outputs. For e.g., ratios of crop types, irrigation technology, rainfed or irrigated field for the duration of the simulation
	df_sys = SD6Model.get_df_sys(m, df_farmers, df_fields, df_wells, df_aquifers)

7. Read the metrices (Root Mean Square Error, Kling-Gupta Efficiency, and Regression Coefficient) based on observed and simulated data for given targets: groundwater saturated thickness, withdrawal, ratio of rainfed or irrigated fields, and ratio of crop types grown.

.. code-block:: python
	
	metrices = m.get_metrices(df_sys, data)

Creating simple input dictionaries to set up and run an SD-6 LEMA simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyCHAMP provides the functionality for users to tailor their input dictionaries, ensuring the simulation is customized for their specific need. This section guides users through the process of constructing basic input dictionaries for the PyCHAMP package's different classes to simulate the SD-6 LEMA scenario. In the forthcoming example, we simulate three individual farmer agents, each managing a single field with no splits and a single well, located in an area served by one aquifer. Each farmer considers the other two farmers in their decision-making network, meaning the choices of one can influence others. The crop choices available are corn, sorghum, and soybeans, while the selected irrigation technology is center pivot LEPA. Graphical representation of the setup, essential parameters, and their associated values for the behavior agents are illustrated and outlined in the subsequent figure and table.

   Illustration of a simple setup for an SD-6 LEMA model.

   *Note: Each behavior agent is in a network with others*.

.. csv-table:: Important attributes and their values associated with different behavior agents
   :file: simpleInput.csv
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

The following section outlines a detailed process for generating input dictionaries and executing an SD-6 LEMA model simulation.

1. Begin by importing the SD-6 LEMA model into your working environment from the package.

.. code-block:: python

	from py_champ.models.sd6_model import SD6Model

2. Specify the available crop types and irrigation technologies, along with the number of splits for each farmer agent's field.

.. code-block:: python

	crop_options = ["corn", "sorghum", "soybeans"]
	tech_options = ["center pivot LEPA"] 
	area_split = 1	

3. Assign seasonally adjusted precipitation levels to each crop: It's crucial to align the precipitation availability with the distinct growing seasons of various crops. Pre-calculated precipitation values for different crops are provided in the example dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

	prec_aw_step = {
	    "prec_aw1": {
	        2017: {"corn": 51.67, "sorghum": 39.71, "soybeans": 39.67},
	        2018: {"corn": 43.84, "sorghum": 41.29, "soybeans": 39.86},
	        2019: {"corn": 66.35, "sorghum": 43.86, "soybeans": 43.44},
	        2020: {"corn": 26.33, "sorghum": 21.48, "soybeans": 20.85},
	        2021: {"corn": 38.57, "sorghum": 27.82, "soybeans": 27.64},
	        2022: {"corn": 21.87, "sorghum": 16.41, "soybeans": 16.3}
	    }
	}

4. Define the truncated normal distribution parameters: Estimating the perceived risk that farmers associate with cultivating each type of crop in each field requires defining the truncated normal distribution parameters. The following dictionary provides pre-calculated parameters required for the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

	truncated_normal = {
	    "corn": (-2.0, 2.0, 36.42, 12.20),
	    "sorghum": (-2.0, 2.0, 36.63, 9.34),
	    "soybeans": (-2.0, 2.0, 29.40, 8.69)
	}

5. Assemble a settings dictionary for an aquifer: As stated in :ref:`py_champ_entities_aquifer`, the aquifer setting dictionary consists of the following keys.

	- 'aq_a' and 'aq_b': coefficients used in the static inflow calculation
	- 'area': the area of the aquifer [ha]
	- 'sy': the specific yield of the underlying aquifer and is used in the dynamic inflow calculation [-].
	- 'init': a dictionary containing initial conditions such as the saturated thickness (st [m]) and initial water level change (dwl [m]).

.. code-block:: python

	aquifers_dict = {
	    "aquifer1": {
	        "aq_a": 0.0004,
	        "aq_b": 0.8,
	        "area": None, # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "sy": None,   # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "init": {
	            "st": 30,
	            "dwl": -0.4
	            }
	        }
	    }

6. Construct a setting dictionary for fields: Refer to :ref:`py_champ_entities_field` for detailed description of field settings dictionary. A field dictionary consists of the following keys.

	- 'field_area': The total area of the field [ha].
	- 'water_yield_curves': Water yield response curves for different crops.
	- 'tech_pumping_rate_coefs': Coefficients for calculating pumping rates based on irrigation technology.
	- 'prec_aw_id': Identifier for available precipitation data.
	- 'init': Initial conditions: irrigation technology, crop type, and field type.
	
.. code-block:: python

	            },
	        "truncated_normal_pars": truncated_normal,
	        'irr_freq': 0.5
	        },

	        'irr_freq': 1.0
	        },
	    
	    "field3": {
	        "field_area": 80.,
	        "water_yield_curves": None, # given as an input in the shared_config dictionary 
	        "tech_pumping_rate_coefs": None, # given as an input in the shared_config dictionary

11. Setup any additional inputs and model parameters.

.. code-block:: python 

	# seed for model replicability and comparison
	seed = 12345

	# pre-calibrated parameters for simulation 
	pars = {'perceived_risk': 0.7539,
			 'forecast_trust': 0.8032,
			 'sa_thre': 0.1421,
			 'un_thre': 0.0773}

12. Initialize a new instance of the SD-6 LEMA model with the compiled settings, initial, start, and end years.

.. code-block:: python 

	m = SD6Model(
	    pars=pars, 
	    crop_options=crop_options,

Creating advanced input dictionaries to set up run an SD-6 LEMA Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A feature aspect of PyCHAMP is its adaptability, allowing users to customize various components, such as the assets and networks of agents. To illustrate this, a scenario with two aquifers and four behavioral agents, each possessing different assets, is established. Farmers are presented with a selection of crops — corn, sorghum, wheat, and soybeans — with the added option of leaving fields fallow. The irrigation technology choices have also been expanded to include both center pivot LEPA and standard center pivot systems. The figure and table provided below illustrate and outline the setup of the model, assets of each behavioral agent, and the characteristics of the assets under their management.

   Illustration of an advanced setup for an SD-6 LEMA model.

   *Note: Each behavior agent is in a network with others in the same aquifer region*.

.. csv-table:: Important attributes and their values associated with different behavior agents
   :file: model_flexibility.csv
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

*Note: Multiple fields for behavior agents are given as (field1, field2), and their corresponding attribute values are given as (value1, value2), respectively, and multiple wells for behavior agents are given as [well1, well2], and their corresponding attribute values are given as [value1, value2], respectively*.

Simulating an SD-6 LEMA model consists of the following steps:

1. Import the model, define crop and irrigation types, and area split.

.. code-block:: python

	from py_champ.models.sd6_model import SD6Model
	crop_options = ["corn", "sorghum", "soybeans", "wheat", "fallow"]
	tech_options = ["center pivot LEPA", "center pivot"]
	area_split = 1

2. Load available precipitation for different crops and years.

.. code-block:: python

	prec_aw_step = {
	    "prec_aw1": {
	        2017: {"corn": 51.67, "sorghum": 39.71, "soybeans": 39.67, "wheat": 28.77, "fallow": 0},
	        2018: {"corn": 43.84, "sorghum": 41.29, "soybeans": 39.86, "wheat": 56.34, "fallow": 0},
	        2019: {"corn": 66.35, "sorghum": 43.86, "soybeans": 43.44, "wheat": 23.72, "fallow": 0},
	        2020: {"corn": 26.33, "sorghum": 21.48, "soybeans": 20.85, "wheat": 33.69, "fallow": 0},
	        2021: {"corn": 38.57, "sorghum": 27.82, "soybeans": 27.64, "wheat": 14.23, "fallow": 0},
	        2022: {"corn": 21.87, "sorghum": 16.41, "soybeans": 16.3, "wheat": 35.93, "fallow": 0}
	    },

	    "prec_aw2": {
	            2017: {"corn": 51.41, "sorghum": 36.66, "soybeans": 36.57, "wheat": 26.53, "fallow": 0},
	            2018: {"corn": 38.85, "sorghum": 38.55, "soybeans": 36.64, "wheat": 57.79, "fallow": 0},
	            2019: {"corn": 62.73, "sorghum": 41.1, "soybeans": 40.09, "wheat": 24.9, "fallow": 0},
	            2020: {"corn": 28.04, "sorghum": 24.92, "soybeans": 24.32, "wheat": 34.34, "fallow": 0},
	            2021: {"corn": 33.32, "sorghum": 21.98, "soybeans": 21.47, "wheat": 16.16, "fallow": 0},
	            2022: {"corn": 25.6, "sorghum": 20.64, "soybeans": 20.58, "wheat": 31.66, "fallow": 0}
	        }
	}

3. Define the truncated normal distribution parameters based on precipitation values for different fields.

.. code-block:: python

	truncated_normal = {
	        "truncated_normal1": {'corn': (-2.0, 2.0, 36.4281, 12.2074),
	          'sorghum': (-2.0, 2.0, 30.6343, 9.3417),
	          'soybeans': (-2.0, 2.0, 29.4087, 8.6906),
	          'wheat': (-2.0, 2.0, 32.5543, 10.3999),
	          'fallow': None
	        },

	        "truncated_normal2": {'corn': (-2.0, 2.0, 36.3425, 10.6622),
	          'sorghum': (-2.0, 2.0, 30.4481, 8.2296),
	          'soybeans': (-2.0, 2.0, 29.1337, 7.5551),
	          'wheat': (-2.0, 2.0, 33.5043, 10.5370),
	          'fallow': None
	        }
	}

4. Assemble a settings dictionary for aquifers.

.. code-block:: python

	aquifers_dict = {
	    "aquifer1": {
	        "aq_a": 0.0004,
	        "aq_b": 0.8,
	        "area": None,  # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "sy": None,    # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "init": {
	            "st": 31.67,
	            "dwl": -0.4
	            }
	        },

	    "aquifer2": {
	        "aq_a": 0.0006,
	        "aq_b": 0.9,
	        "area": None,  # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "sy": None,    # Not required for static inflow calculation
	        "init": {
	            "st": 65,
	            "dwl": -1.0
	            }
	        }
	    }

5. Construct a setting dictionary for fields.

9. Prepare a shared configuration dictionary.

*Note*:

*1. Users have the option to input costs associated with irrigation technology and crop changes. The costs are set as 0 for the purpose of this example*.

*2. The settings under gurobi dictionary has keys that directs the optimization problem to stop at a certain time limit or percentage difference between the upper and lower bounds of the solution for which the current solution can be considered an optimal one. Users can use the key as per their need*.

10. Setup any additional inputs and model parameters.

.. code-block:: python 

	# seed for model replicability and comparison
	seed = 12345

	# pre-calibrated parameters for simulation
	pars = {'perceived_risk': 0.7539,
			 'forecast_trust': 0.8032,
			 'sa_thre': 0.1421,
			 'un_thre': 0.0773}

11. Initialize a new instance of the SD-6 LEMA model with the compiled settings, initial, start, and end years.
