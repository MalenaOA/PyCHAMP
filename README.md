## Overview

PyCHAMP (Crop-Hydrological-Agent Modeling Platform) is an open-source Python package specifically developed for analyzing policies and assessing decision-making processes in agro-hydrological systems. This platform is particularly useful for systems characterized by complex interactions between human activities and natural resources. PyCHAMP is structured into five core componentsâ€”**Aquifer**, **Field**, **Well**, **Finance**, and **Behavior**. Each component acts as a module, encapsulating classes that represent different agent types within these systems.

In PyCHAMP, a **component** is implemented as a module, which is a file containing Python statements and definitions. This includes classes and functions relevant to that component. An **agent type** is implemented as a class, serving as a template for creating agent objects. These objects encapsulate both attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define their behavior. PyCHAMP includes five default agent types, one for each component: **Aquifer**, **Field**, **Well**, **Finance**, and **Behavior**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing PyCHAMP, you must install the Gurobi optimization software, which PyCHAMP depends on for certain computations.

1. **Install Gurobi**:
   - Gurobi is available under a free academic license for qualified users. Detailed instructions on how to download and install Gurobi can be found at the [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses).

### Installing PyCHAMP

You can install PyCHAMP directly from the source or via the repository on GitHub:
- **From GitHub**:
  ```bash
  pip install .
  ```

- **From the source**:
  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/philip928lin/PyCHAMP.git
  ```
